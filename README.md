- [Expo Router](https://expo.github.io/router) (file-based navigation)
- [expo-sqlite](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite/) for native storage
- **localStorage** fallback for web
- [expo-file-system](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/filesystem/) + [expo-sharing](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/sharing/) for CSV exports
- [dayjs](https://day.js.org/) for date handling

## ðŸ“¦ Data Storage Model

- **Android / iOS**
  - Data saved to a local **SQLite** database inside the app sandbox.
  - Each device has its own data (not shared).
  - Data persists until the app is uninstalled or cache is cleared.
- **Web**
  - Data saved in **browser localStorage**.
  - Persists until site data is cleared (or private browsing is used).
- **No cloud backend** â€” all data is local.
- Exports are saved:
  - **Native:** to `FileSystem.documentDirectory/exports/â€¦` and optionally shared via OS share sheet.
  - **Web:** downloaded as `.csv`.

---
## Notes on Privacy

- - All data is local to the userâ€™s device.

- - No data is uploaded or synced to a server.

- - Different users cannot see each otherâ€™s history unless they explicitly export and share CSVs.
